By Nicholas Florian:

You will need to move test and scaffold (h and c) files into your project to run scaffold.

My makefile has a way to run scaffold test with the current project. Ask me for anything else.

Make sure to use scaffold.txt with the program, it keeps track of the current unit test.

The last unit test/system test will fail int test.c unless to change the file being tested.

./bin/test scaffold.txt
